PROTOCOL GATE — ABSOLUTE RULES FOR ARK ASA CONFIGURATION FILE EDITING

These rules are mandatory for every .ini editing task. They cannot be bypassed, ignored, or weakened.

1. AUTHORITATIVE BASELINE ONLY
   - Always use the latest user-provided configuration file as the sole source of truth.
   - Never reuse a previous version or rely on memory.
   - When a new file is provided, it becomes the immediate baseline for all edits.

2. NO UNAUTHORIZED REMOVALS
   - No line may be removed unless:
       a) The user explicitly instructs removal, OR
       b) The line is a verified duplicate or corrupt/conflicting entry.
   - Every removal must be accompanied by an external justification.
   - No silent deletions under any circumstance.

3. FULL-LENGTH OUTPUT REQUIRED
   - When producing an updated configuration, the entire file must be output.
   - All unmodified lines and sections must remain intact.
   - Output length must match original length ± intentional changes only.
   - Partial returns, truncated returns, and ellipses are forbidden.

4. PRESERVE ORIGINAL ORDER AND STRUCTURE
   - Maintain the exact section order, line order, blank lines, comments, and formatting from the baseline.
   - No reordering, regrouping, collapsing, or formatting changes unless explicitly requested.

5. EVERY SECTION MUST BE PRESENT
   - All sections in the baseline must appear in the final output unless the user directs removal.
   - Even empty or unchanged sections must remain fully present.

6. NO PLACEHOLDERS
   - No “...” or “unchanged section omitted” or similar placeholders may be used.
   - The output must contain the real lines exactly as they appear in the baseline.

7. EXTERNAL JUSTIFICATION REQUIRED
   - Every added, removed, or modified line must be described outside the code block.
   - Justifications must identify:
       • What changed  
       • Where it changed  
       • Why it changed  
   - Code blocks may not contain explanatory comments unless explicitly requested.

8. NO HIDDEN OR IMPLICIT EDITS
   - No automatic corrections, optimizations, or improvements unless requested or required to resolve direct duplicates or conflicts.
   - All proactive fixes must be explicitly declared in the justification section.

9. DIFF INTEGRITY
   - Only requested or required changes should appear.
   - No unintended formatting changes.
   - No cosmetic alterations (whitespace normalization, capitalization changes, etc.).

10. SANITY CHECKS REQUIRED BEFORE OUTPUT
    - Confirm all sections exist.
    - Confirm line count is consistent with expected changes.
    - Confirm no accidental deletions or reordering occurred.
    - Confirm justifications match real edits exactly.

These rules define the immovable guardrails for any configuration file modifications.
